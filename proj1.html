          <h2>Nickol Tesla</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Nickol Tesla</strong> 10 July  - 1856  7 January 1943 was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist.
             He is best-known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. 
             He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.ith the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop
            a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888,
              earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.  Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.
            He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.  In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project,
            an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. 
            There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990.

            <li>
                <a href="">The Tesla Coil</a> It is a transformer used to produce high-voltage, low-current, 
                high-frequency alternating-current electricity. To observers, it appears as if lightning is being shot into the air. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">The Magnifying Transmitter</a> Using a  magnifying transmitter, he was also reportedly able to light a field of bulbs at a distance of 1 km.
                 The magnifying transmitter was an adaptation of the Tesla coil
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href=""> The Tesla Turbine</a> Tesla saw the rise of the piston engine in the automobile industry as a way to make a change in the world.
                He developed his own turbine-style engine that used combustion to make disks rotate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="">The Shadowgraph</a> Nikola Tesla may well have produced the first X-ray image in the United States
               when he attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an image of Mark Twain.
            </li>
            <li>
             <a href="">The Neon Lamp </a> Tesla did not invent fluorescent or neon lights, but he did contribute to improving both inventions.
              He took the lights and created the first neon sign.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="">The Niagara Falls Transformer House</a> When it came to deciding what company would build a power generator at Niagara Falls,
                 Thomas Edison was the first choice. After reviewing Tesla’s work for Westinghouse Electric, though,
                 the Niagara Falls commission went with Tesla’s alternating current power.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="">The Induction Motor</a> The first AC commutator-free three-phase induction motor was invented independently by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Although Ferraris presented his engine first, in 1885,
               it was Tesla who filed for a patent first.
            </li>
            <li>
             <a href="">Alternating Current</a> Alternating current is considered Tesla’s crowning achievement.
              While not the inventor of AC power, he made it easy to use widely.
             AC power allows for electricity to be sent over long distances much more efficiently.
